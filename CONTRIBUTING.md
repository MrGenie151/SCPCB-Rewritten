# Contributing to SCP:CBR
First of all, thanks for considering to contribute! This is a project that I think will benifit from more people writing code than just me alone.
SCP: CB's codebase is notoriously a mess, so I'm glad you're willing to help trudge through it with me.

As some guidelines, here are some dos and don'ts when it comes to submitting a PR.

**DO:**
- Test your PR to ensure it is functional.
- Test your additions to ensure parity with the original game. Accuracy is a high priority with this project.
- Keep your code neat. Complicated code should be commented to prevent ambiguity.

**DON'T:**
- Write code with LLMs (AI). If you can't code, don't contribute.
- Add things irrevelent to the original game.
- Redistribute the code not under the CC BY-SA license.

Happy contributing!
