# SCP: Containment Breach - Rewritten
SCP: Containment Breach rewritten in Haxe with Raylib, as a direct engine replacement for Blitz3D dedicated to accuracy to the original game.

Though I (GenieCMD) plan to do a chunk of the work, contributing is always welcome for assistance. Submit a pull request and I'll get to it as soon as I can :)

# Building
Because it is built with Haxe, it requires both Haxe and a C++ compiler in order to build it.

Also, if you are on Unix please install Raylib's development dependencies. The guide for installing those can be found [here](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-GNU-Linux#install-required-libraries).

Simply run `haxe build-<platform>.hxml` to build it. Builds should be output in the `bin` directory.

!!! WE MAY SWITCH TO LIME FOR OUR BUILD SYSTEM IN THE FUTURE!
